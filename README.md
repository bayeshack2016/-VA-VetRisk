VA Vet Risk assesment prediction models using ICPSR 35037 dataset

Disclaimer: Due to very poor datasets provided (no outcomes, some outcomes but very few patients, etc.) this risk assesment models are not tied to a particular outcome (i.e suicide), but rather a set out potential outcomes
which one of them might (probably) be suicide

<h1>The short and swift explanation </h1>

Utility: When trying to tacke suicide prediction, it is imperative to have a nice dataset with outcomes. However, ICPSR 35037 provided the second best thing - Veterans that have been admitted to substance abuse treatment facilities. This project is flexible enough as to be able to take any similar input (for later years) or allow researchers to format their data in this way to take advantage of the project's models. This will allow researchers to asses the risk of any veteran in real time (can be formulated as a questionary) and run the model to get an outcome probability.

Ambition: To my knowledge there hasn't been a project for risk assessment done on this particular dataset (due to the lack of an outcome variable probably). This project is an exploratory piece on the dataset and its variables to try to classify veteran patients to a finite set of potential outcomes.

Polish: All code has been included here for reproducibility. Due to the DUA of the dataset, I am not attaching it to the repository. However, all analysis results and variables of interest are described in the files.
